# env-restore
The main purpose of this action is to make the code of cmake-utils available in a job even if it uses no other actions
from this repository. Without this action, the CMake code, e.g. the files in `modules` might not be available for a
build.

Care must be taken to use the very same version for the actions [`configure`](../configure) and `env-restore`.

## Inputs
- `env-file` - The file with the environment generated by the action [`msvc-dev-env`](../msvc-dev-env).

## Use Cases
### Restore Build Environment
The following code adds the contens from `my.env` to the environment. Additionally, using this actions ensures that
the runner downloads the code from cmake-utils to the worker.
~~~yml
    - name: Restore Build Environment
      uses: mbeckh/cmake-utils/env-restore@v1
      with:
        env-file: my.env
~~~
